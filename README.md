# About the project
Friendly app arises as a group idea and its purpose is to become a social network *In a future* . The name originates in the middle of the **quarantine**, together with the main idea of the project.  The need to seek *accompaniment* in these situations gave impetus to the project, but now that the quarantine has been completed, the idea has been reduced to a social network. 

## ScreenShots

Well now I'm going to show a few screenshots of the application itself.
